The index.html file contains the HTML structure and content of the website.
The css directory contains the compiled CSS file, main.css, generated from the SCSS.
The scss directory contains the SCSS file, main.scss, where you can make changes to the styling of the website.
The assets directory holds the images used in the website, such as the salon and services images.
Customization
You can customize the website according to the specific needs of the nail salon business. To modify the styling, open the main.scss file and update the variables and styles as desired. Run a SCSS compiler to generate the corresponding CSS file.

To add or modify the content of the website, make changes directly in the index.html file. Update the introduction and services sections to reflect the offerings of the nail salon business.
